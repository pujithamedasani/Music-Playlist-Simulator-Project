# Music Playlist Simulator

A project demonstrating how to design, document, and implement a simple music playlist simulator. This repository includes:

* **Source code** implementing playlist operations
* **Presentation (PPT)** summarizing the system
* **Technical report** detailing the design and implementation

## Overview

The simulator allows users to:

* Add, remove, and reorder tracks
* Create and manage custom playlists
* Simulate playback controls such as play, pause, next, and previous
* Track playlist statistics

## Features

* Modular code structure for easy extension
* Clear separation between logic, data, and interface
* Presentation deck explaining architecture and flow
* Report providing deeper technical context
